# NuGrid Collaboration

The Nucleosynthesis Grid (NuGrid) collaboration, formed in fall 2007, develops
and maintains tools for large scale post-processing nucleosynthesis simulations
with up-to-date and flexible nuclear physics input, and apply these to complete
sets of quiescent and explosive nuclear production environments.
